# Bulk Box 🃏

This is a **work-in-progress Yugioh card collection app**.

I got tired of the existing Yugioh collection apps.  
Some are bloated, some are expensive, some are slow, some do too much, and some somehow still don’t do the one thing I want properly.

So instead of complaining… I started building my own.

No big vision pitch. No grand roadmap.  
Just a Flutter app that lets me **browse Yugioh cards and track my own collection** the way *I* like it.

Feel free to buy me a coffee. Coffee motivates me to work on stuff.

I am fishing for ideas how to handle new users that already own large collections. I am thinking of making my own AI to handle it, but that needs a lot more coffee.

## What is this?

- A Yugioh card **collection tracker**
- A place to **look up card data**
- A personal project I work on when I feel like it
- Definitely **not finished**
- Probably opinionated (definitely)
- Built mainly because I was bored and annoyed

If it ends up useful to others, cool.  
If not, hey, we are Yu-Gi-Oh players, pain is familiar.

---

## What works (so far)

- Browse Yugioh cards
- Search for cards
- View card details
- Start tracking owned cards

That’s it.  
More stuff will appear as I feel like adding it.

---

## What doesn’t exist yet (but might)

- Proper collection stats
- Import/export
- Syncing
- Price tracking (kinda doubt this, but I do think I will add a link to popular sites and you can check there)
- Deck building
- Any kind of polish guarantee 😅

Basically: **don’t expect magic**, expect progress when motivation hits.

## Tech stuff

- Built with **Flutter**
- Runs on mobile & web
- Data handling is evolving as the app evolves
- Structure may change, break, or get refactored on a whim
